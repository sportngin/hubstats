# Hubstats [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sportngin/hubstats.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sportngin/hubstats)

Hubstats is a rails plugin which allows you to search and monitor pull requests made across a collection of repositories. It also gives extra statistics about users and pull requests not found on GitHub.

## Setup

The following setup is designed to only be used when integrating this plugin into a rails application or for when adding new migrations.

 Run `rails generate hubstats:install`.

 Run `rake hubstats:install:migrations`.

 Run `rake hubstats:setup` to run the necessary migrations and start pulling data from Github.

 Add 'mount Hubstats::Engine => "/hubstats"' to your apps routes file.

## Configuration

### Authentication

Hubstats needs Github credentials to access your repos, these can be setup in one of two ways:

#### Configuring the `octokit.yml`

Add your GitHub API token or ClientID and Secret to `octokit.yml`.

#### Environment Variables

Hubstats can also use OAUTH access tokens stored in ENV["GITHUB_API_TOKEN"] or for Application Authentication in ENV["CLIENT_ID"] and ENV["CLIENT_SECRET"], if for some reason you don't want to store them in `octokit.yml`.

### Webhooks

Hubstats uses GitHub webhooks to keep itself updated. It requires you to set a secret as well as an endpoint to push to.

To generate a secret run:

 ```
 ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'
 ``` 

Set the endpoint to be:

 www.yourdomain.com/hubstats/handler

### Repositories 

Hubstats needs to know what repos for it to watch. You can set it to watch either an entire organization or a list of specific repos in octokit.yml.

## Testing

All of the automated tests are written in RSpec. Since hubstats is a plugin, not an application, we need to install the plugin into a Rails application to run. The `test` directory is a dummy rails application for manually testing the UI by serving hubstats locally. When developing and using the `test/dummy` locally, then the test will automatically sync with any updated code, so it doesn't need to be re-served when changes are made with the normal Rails application. When in the development process, one just needs to run `bundle exec rails s` once from the command line (while in `test/dummy`) to serve the plugin. http://guides.rubyonrails.org/plugins.html will give more information on the implementation of a Rails plugin. 

## TL:DR

  Run `rails generate hubstats:install`.
  
  Configure `octokit.yml` with your Github information.
  
  Run `rake hubstats:install:migrations`.
  
  Run `rake hubstats:setup`.
  
  Add 'mount Hubstats::Engine => "/hubstats"' to your routes file.
